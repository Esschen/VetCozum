<h2>General Consultation / Health Exams:</h2><p><img src="img/catfadime.jpg" align="right" width="150px" hspace="5">
General consultations do not require appointment but occasionally additional time may be needed for an individual case or emergency.
For this reason, we recommend you to give us a short call to secure your appointment if your schedule is tight. During an exam, we perform a “nose to tail” examination of your pet. 
Examinations are a great opportunity learn more about your pet’s health. The information we collect during an exam allows us to spot the signs of disease and illness and treat them before they can adversely affect your pet’s quality of life. 
These examinations also help us establish a relationship with your pet. During an exam, we get to know your pet and learn about its lifestyle, personality, health risks and other important details.<br><br>
Consultation services include nutrition advice, general pet care and dental care advice, parasite prevention and any other topics that you would like to get informed.
It will be our pleasure to address your questions and help you and your pet.</p>
<h2>Vaccinations:</h2><p>Vaccinations are one of the most important parts of your pet's preventive health care plan.
Many diseases once fatal to pets can now be prevented through the use of vaccinations. We provide vaccinations for dogs, cats and rabbits.
We advise that your pet receives an initial course of vaccinations and thereafter annual boosters.
For more information please visit our vaccination page <a href="vaccination.html">here.</a></p>
<h2>Surgery:</h2><p>We are equipped with modern tools and our priority is maintaining high standards of hygiene and the sterilisation procedures.
Our operations range from routine neutering, to soft tissue surgery. We always recommend a face-to-face consultation to decide the most appropriate operation for your pet.
We perform any routine surgeries from Monday to Saturday.
<br><br>To minimize the possibility of complications during the operation, we will always carry out a physical exam before any medications are given.
We may also carry out a blood test beforehand if needed.</p>
<h2>Medications / Prescription:</h2><p>We stock most medications in our clinic and prescribe them anytime without any delay or additional effort on your side.
Repeat prescriptions if required are made available as well. The vet will advise you on the instructions. If a pet needs long-term medication for a chronic condition,
please give us 24-hour notice by phone or e-mail so we can have the medication ready for you to collect on time.</p>
<h2>Pet Shop:</h2><p>We stock quality pet items in Vet-Cozum and can order anytime depending on the request and quantity.
We recommend you to contact us in advance to collect the pet shop items quickly.</p>
<h2>Referrals:</h2><p>Vet-Cozum delivers daily services 6 days a week and emergency services 24/7. However, from time to time, we may need to refer your pet to another specialist.</p>
